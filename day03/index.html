        <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
        HTML <i>(Hypertext Markup language)</i> is used to create documents on the <u>World Wide Web</u>. 
        <em>It is simply a collection of certain keywords called "Tags" that are helpful in writing the document to 
        be displayed using a browser on the Internet</em>. HTML was developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in 1992.
